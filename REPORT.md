# Supplementary-CP3402 Project Report

## Project Overview

The Supplementary-CP3402 project is a WordPress child theme development initiative based on the OceanWP theme. This project includes the setup of a WordPress environment using Docker and Docker Compose, along with the creation of a custom child theme. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in WordPress development, Docker, and continuous deployment practices.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **WordPress**: A popular content management system (CMS) used for building websites and blogs.
- **OceanWP**: A versatile and customizable WordPress theme.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **MySQL**: A widely-used relational database management system.
- **Git**: A version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: A practice that ensures every change is automatically prepared for a release to production.

## Skills Developed

Throughout this project, I have developed and honed several key skills:

- **WordPress Development**: Gained experience in creating and customizing WordPress child themes.
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Learned how to containerize applications and manage multi-container environments.
- **Version Control**: Enhanced proficiency in using Git for version control and collaboration.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Implemented CD practices to automate the deployment process.
- **Documentation**: Improved skills in writing clear and concise documentation for technical projects.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Theme Development**: Created and customized the OceanWP child theme to meet specific design and functionality requirements.
- **Environment Setup**: Configured the Docker and Docker Compose environment to ensure a consistent development and production setup.
- **Database Management**: Managed the MySQL database for WordPress, including schema design and data migration.
- **Version Control**: Maintained the project's Git repository, ensuring all changes were tracked and documented.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Set up and managed the CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
- **Documentation**: Authored comprehensive documentation, including the README and this project report, to facilitate understanding and onboarding for new team members.

## Continuous Deployment Process

To ensure a smooth and automated deployment process, the following Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline was implemented:

1. **Version Control with Git**: All code changes are committed to a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
2. **Dockerization**: The application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose to ensure consistency across different environments.
3. **Automated Builds**: A CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions) is configured to automatically build the Docker images whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
4. **Deployment**: The built Docker images are deployed to a production environment. This can be achieved using various deployment strategies, such as rolling updates or blue-green deployments.
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment, the application is monitored for any issues, and automated rollback mechanisms are in place to revert to the previous stable version if necessary.

## Conclusion

The Supplementary-CP3402 project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply and expand my skills in WordPress development, Docker, and continuous deployment. This project showcases my ability to work with modern web technologies and tools, making me a strong candidate for roles that require these skills.
